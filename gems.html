                            <p>
                                Sri Lanka's nem industry has a very long and colorful history. Sri Lanka was affectionately known as RatnaDweepa
                                which means Gem Island. The name is a reflection of its natural wealth. Marco Polo smote that the
                                island had the best sapphires, topazes, amethysts, and other gems in the world. Ptolemy, the 2nd century
                                astronomer recorded that beryl and sapphire were the mainstay of Sri Lanka's gem Industry. Records from
                                r:••ariors that visited the island states that they brought back "Jewels of Serendib". Serendib was the ancient
                                name given to the island by middle - eastern and Persian traders that crossed the Indian Ocean to trade gems
                                from Sri Lanka to the East durino the 4th and 5th century.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Sri Lanka, geologically speaking is an extremely old country. Ninety percent of the rocks of the island are of
                                Precambrian age, 560 million to 2,400 million years ago. The gems form in sedimentary residual gem deposits,
                                eluvial deposits, metamorphic deposits, skarn and calcium -rich rocks. Other gems are of magmatic origin.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Res/dual deposits are mainly found in flood plains of rivers and streams. The metamorphic types of gems
                                constitute 90% of the gem deposits in Sri Lanka. Sn Lanka has the highest density of gem deposits compared
                                to its landmass. Ratnapura contains the most gem deposits and derived its name front the gem industry.
                                Ratnapura means "city of gems".
